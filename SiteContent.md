Description: Acted as Project Coordinator and developer for a SAAS application, specializing in team workflow and feature delivery. Led Agile planning and developed the "tips contribution" module using modern Next.js. This experience highlights strong leadership, translating complex customer service requirements into functional software, and managing feature delivery.

Tech Stack: Next.js, React Context, Agile Methodology, Project Coordination

E. About & Experience (#about)
Core Message:

I am a Full-Stack AI Integration Engineer built on a foundation of mathematical rigor and direct customer empathy. My B.Sc. in Math is the core of my approach, enabling me to focus on algorithmic efficiency and the data analysis critical for effective RAG and LLM Fine-Tuning. Completing the Google AI Essentials Course formalized my technical knowledge. Years in management and customer service gives me the unique ability to translate complex user pain points into clear, functional, and intelligent software solutions.

1. UI Layout & Component Suggestions
   Using Tailwind CSS speeds up development immensely. I highly recommend using a free component library to kickstart the basic structure.

Component / Section Tailwind Design Suggestion Free Component Libraries
Overall Layout Single-Page Scroll: All content is on one page for immediate visibility. Use full-width sections that alternate between dark backgrounds (for professionalism) and light/accent backgrounds (for project details). HyperUI, Flowbite: Offer free, well-designed components like navigation, buttons, and feature sections ready to be customized with Tailwind.
Hero Section Centrally Aligned, High Contrast: Large, bold typography over a subtle abstract tech background. The call-to-action button should use the accent color. HyperUI (Marketing Hero Sections)
Skills Section Animated Chip Grid: Use small, rectangular chips (badges) for each skill. Group them clearly. This is a great place for micro-interactions (see below). Flowbite (Badges), HyperUI (Badges)
Projects Section 3-Column Card Layout: Three distinct, attention-grabbing cards. Use a dark, hover-to-light effect on the card borders or background to draw the eye to the details. Flowbite (Cards), HyperUI (Cards)

Export to Sheets 2. Iconography: The AI & Tech Aesthetic
A single, consistent icon set is crucial for professionalism. SVG-based sets are best for crispness and Tailwind compatibility.

Icon Set Recommendation Style & Why it Fits the Role Where to Use

1. Lucide or Feather Icons Minimalist and Crisp: Clean lines and small strokes. These are popular in modern tech portfolios and are easy to integrate with React (Next.js). Navigation, Social links, Small bullets next to skill chips.
2. Tabler Icons More Variety, Technical: Tabler has over 4,000 icons, often featuring detailed technical concepts that would be perfect for illustrating AI/data themes (e.g., brain, network, robot). Project Feature lists, Headers for the Skills section (e.g., a "code" icon for Full-Stack, a "brain" icon for AI).
3. Heroicons Tailwind Creators: If you want absolute, built-in consistency, Heroicons (by the Tailwind team) is a simple, effective choice for UI essentials. Buttons, Arrows, Basic UI elements.

Export to Sheets 3. Framer Motion (Motion Library) Suggestions
Framer Motion helps inject life without feeling gimmicky. Focus on subtle, purposeful motion that makes the content feel responsive and high-quality.

Motion Type Implementation Detail (How) Where to Use (Effect & Purpose)
Subtle Fade-In (Parallax Scroll) Use the whileInView prop. Define initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }} and animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}. Section Titles & Project Cards: As the user scrolls, each project card or section title slides up slightly and fades into view. This creates a sense of depth and makes the site feel fast and interactive.
Hover Scale/Shadow Use the whileHover prop. Define whileHover={{ scale: 1.03, boxShadow: "0px 0px 8px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.7)" }} Project Cards & CTA Buttons: When the user hovers over a project card, it subtly grows and gains a glowing shadow (using the accent color). This directs attention to the key actions.
Micro-Interaction (Staggered Children) Use the staggerChildren and delayChildren on a parent element (Skills container). Skill Chips: Instead of all skills appearing at once, make them pop in one after another (staggered). This draws the eye across the skills list, showcasing the breadth of her expertise.
Page Flip/Route Transition Use Framer Motion's AnimatePresence wrapper around the page content. Navigation: If using a multi-page setup, a simple, fast horizontal slide or a full-page fade between routes (pages) is elegant and smooth, avoiding jarring jumps. (A subtle blur effect can also work here if transitioning background images).

Export to Sheets 4. Free Image Placeholders (The Aesthetic)
Since the target role is AI/Data, the imagery should be dark, abstract, and technical, hinting at data structures and intelligence.

Use Case Description & Aesthetic Focus Image Source Keywords (Unsplash/Freepik/Pexels)
Hero Background Subtle, dark, glowing network/code. Needs to be dark enough that the white text is high-contrast. Avoid complex, distracting lines. abstract technology background, neural network, hexagonal blockchain, digital pixel background
Project 1 (AI Shopping List) Data Visualization: Abstract connections or a glowing graph/chart, suggesting data processing and smart logic. data nodes, abstract lines and dots connect, glowing curve geometric lines
Project 2 & 3 Thumbnails Clean Technology: Minimalist images of a laptop screen with code, or a dark office setting with blue/purple lighting. tech abstract, minimal code screen, dark blue vector background
About/Experience Section Professional Portrait: A clear, modern photo of her, perhaps over a plain, simple background to ensure she is the focus. (Requires personal photo)

Export to Sheets
Actionable Tip: If you use a dark blue/cyan as the primary accent color in your Tailwind configuration (e.g., bg-cyan-500, text-cyan-400), it will beautifully complement the dark, technical background imagery.
